//Since, you can hold only 1 stock at a time. The problem becomes really simple. Just add up the differences between two consecutive days (if profitable).
//Here, you might intuitively think that, holding for more days might yield more profit in some cases.
//In short capture all profits throughout the array

C++ Solution (4ms) :

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0, n = prices.size();
        
        for (int i=1; i<n; ++i) {
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1])
                profit += prices[i]-prices[i-1];
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
};
